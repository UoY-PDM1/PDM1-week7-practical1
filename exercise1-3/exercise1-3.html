    <h1>Exercise 1.3</h1>
    <p>Your sketch:</p>
    <div class="guidance">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This is exercise is quite challenging! Your goal is to create a simple drawing application that allows 
                the user to pick the colour and size of their brush. They can also clear the screen to start a new drawing. 
                The video below shows a complete application that has a little extra polish to make the application easier 
                to use (the text labels for the controls and the brush preview). You can choose to focus on just the main functionality if you prefer.
            </p>
            <p>Create an 800 by 600 canvas and add the three input controls (don't worry about the functionality just yet... simply 
                put the controls on the screen):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A colour picker to select the brush colour.</li>
                <li>A slider to set the brush size.</li>
                <li>A button to clear the canvas.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can put the controls wherever you like--your layout doesn't have to match the video example. To 
                create the slider, consult the documentation for <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createSlider" 
                target="_blank"><code>createSlider()</code></a>. The minimum value should be the smallest size brush in pixels 
                (I used 5). The maximum value should be the largest possible size for the brush (I used 50). The value should 
                be the default size you'd like to use for the brush, which must be within the minimum and maximum values.
            </p>
            <p>The drawing effect is created by drawing a circle at the mouse coordinates when the mouse is pressed. The fill 
                colour of the circle should be the current value of the colour picker, and the diameter of the circle should be 
                the current value of the slider. Getting the value of a slider is exactly the same as getting the value of a 
                colour picker.
            </p>
            <p>Remember there are hints available below the video and you can use <a href="check-exercise1-3.html">check-exercise1-3.html</a> to 
            check your work.</p>
            <p>Expected output:</p>

        <div>
            <button class="btn btn-primary hint" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#hint" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="hint">
                Hint

                    <p>The examples from lecture show how to use a slider as well as the other controls.</p>
                    <p>Where you call <code>background()</code> is important for this exercise. Because 
                    you want every circle placed when the user is drawing to stay on the screen, you should NOT 
                    call <code>background()</code> in <code>draw()</code>. Instead, call it in <code>setup()</code> 
                    to colour the background when the sketch loads. To clear the canvas, call <code>background()</code> 
                    when the clear button is clicked. This should happen in the event handler you create for the button.</p>
                    <p>To draw when the mouse is pressed, use the <code>mouseIsPressed</code> system variable in <code>draw()</code>. 
                    This is simpler and will create a smoother effect than using the <code>mousePressed()</code> event function.</p>
